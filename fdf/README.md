| Description  |  This project is about creating a simple wireframe model of a landspace. |

This project is about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D land-space by linking various point (x, y, z) thanks to line segments (edges).

Your project must comply with the following rules:

- You must use the MiniLibX. Either the version avaliable on the school machines, or installing it using its sources.
