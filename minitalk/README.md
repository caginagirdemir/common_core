# minitalk project

**Project Objectives** : to communicate between two program through signals. to understand bit-shifting, logical operations, kill funcs, signal redirects, signals in linux. Also I wrote a [article](https://medium.com/@cagina/cde-sinyaller-d63297fdc216) in Turkish on Medium.

**Project Instructions**

You must create a communication program in the form of a **client** and a **server**.

- The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID.
- The client takes two parameters:
  - The server PID.
  - The string to send.
- The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server. <br/> Once the string has been received, the server must print it.
- The server has to display the string pretty quickly. Quickly means that if you think it takes too long, the it is probably too long.
- Your server should be able to receive strings from several clients in a row without needing to restart.
- The communication between your client and your server has to be done only using UNIX signals.
- You can only use these two signals: **SIGUSR1** and **SIGUSR2**.
